This was a computer science culminating project that had the following requirements:
- Classes
- Inheritance
- Abstract classes and interfaces
- 2-D arrays (Where appropriate)
- Polymorphism
- File I/O
- Searching (Binary/Sequential)
- Sorting (Bubble/Selection/Insertion/Merge)
- Recursion (where appropriate)
- Overloading and Overriding
- UML Diagrams.
Our project idea was to create a hospital/doctor's office management program where patients with their medical information could be added to a database. The program could be used by administrators,
doctors and patients. Patients could view their own record and request appointments. Doctors could view their appointments, create appointments and view patient reports. Administrators could create new profiles and appointments.
We decided to create the program entirely using Java (including the UI).
